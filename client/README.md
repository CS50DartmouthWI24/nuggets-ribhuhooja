Contains modules associated with the client portion of a nuggets game

The executable program that should be run to play a nuggets game is `client`
The `Makefile` should be run in order to compile the program 

Miniserver and miniclient executables from ../support are compiled and kept in the directory for easy access and use in testing the program. Additionally, the client module relies heavily on structs and modules found in the structure module
