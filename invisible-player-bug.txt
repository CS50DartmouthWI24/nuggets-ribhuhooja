TODO: remove this once the bug is fixed

Bug description - it seems that sometimes players turn "invisible", leaving
their "corpses" behind. Under the hood teh grid has somehow been tricked into 
representing the players with a roomSpot or a passageSpot

The problem likely lies in grid_swapPlayers being called on a wrong coordinate,
perhaps because of a player leaving the game?
